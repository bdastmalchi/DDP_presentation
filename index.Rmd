## Description

- This is an introduction to the application that predicts the stopping distance (ft) of a car based on its speed (mph).

- The prediction is performed by fitting a polynomial to the measured data. 

- Polynomial order can be integers between 1 and 4.

## Usage
cars (dataset)

## Format
A data frame with 50 observations on 2 variables.

[,1]	speed	numeric	Speed (mph)
[,2]	dist	numeric	Stopping distance (ft)

## A plot of the data
```{r, fig.height=6}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
    las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25), lwd = 2, cex.lab = 1.5, col = 2)
```
